<h2>Hi, I'm Alexander. Nice to meet you.</h2>

Since I started my journey as an enterprise software tester 15 years ago, I've been building applications to simplify my work and that of my colleagues. After all these years of improving my skills and gaining experience, I continue to build small and bigger projects playing with different technology stacks and I really enjoy this process.

```js
function getExperienceSummary(experience) {
    switch(experience) {
        case 'SDET':
            return `5+ years of experience as SDET \
                    covering web and desktop automation.`;
        case 'QA':
            return `10+ years of enterprise software testing.`;
        case 'Developer':
            return `5+ years of various development experience \
                    including web, desktop, mobile, and IoT solutions.`;
        default:
            return `Looking forward to learn more about .NET Core \
                    cloud services, containerazation, and devops.`;`
    }
}
```
