Hi, I'm Alexander. Nice to meet you.
---

Since I started my journey as an enterprise software test engineer 15 years ago, I've been building applications to simplify my work and that of my colleagues. After all these years of improving my skills and gaining experience, I continue to build small and bigger projects playing with different technology stacks and I really enjoy this process.

```js
const experience = [
  { role: 'Software Developer', years: 2 },
  { role: 'SDET', years: 5 },
  { role: 'QA Engineer', years: 10 },
];

const languages = ['C#', 'JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'Java', 'PHP', 'C++',
  'Delphi', 'Pascal', 'Basic'];

const tools = ['Apache', 'ASP.NET', 'Azure', 'CodeceptJS', 'Git', 'Jenkins',
  'JMeter', 'JSP', 'MSSQL', 'Node.js', 'Nuke', 'Playwright', 'Postman',
  'Selenium', 'SQLite', 'SVN', 'TFS', 'Tomcat', 'Webpack', 'WinForms', 'WPF'];

const os = ['Windows', 'Linux'];

const others = ['Raspberry Pi', 'Arduino', 'NodeMCU', 'ESP8266'];

function describeExperience() {
  const yearsOfExperience = experience.reduce((total, job) => total + job.years, 0);
  const jobHistory = experience.map(job => `${job.role} for ${job.years} years`);
  const skills = [...programmingLanguages, ...tools, ...os, ...others];
  
  return `With ${yearsOfExperience} years of experience, ` + 
    `I've worked as a ${jobHistory.join(', ')}. My skills include ${skills.join(', ')}.`;
}
```

People I've worked with have said some nice things...

> Lacey and I want you to know that Alexander is a real asset to our team. We previously noticed that he brings thoughtful questions to our planning sessions and he has a good understanding of the product, but when David was on vacation the last two weeks, he did an excellent job of taking on many of her responsibilities. We especially appreciate the work he did to prepare documentation and scenarios for our meeting with client last week (including working some hours one weekend).
- Senior Program Manager

> You are one of my favorites and I have made it very clear to many people here and at there that you are a valuable member of the team. You quickly learned the product, but more importantly I can see that you are good at looking at the whole picture and not focusing only on the specific thing you are testing. This is a skill that is extremely valuable to an organization. I am sure you will be successful at current position and wherever life takes you.

Your contributions have undoubtedly left a lasting impact, and we are grateful for the positive influence you have had on our projects and team dynamics.
Thank you bringing out a lot of automation POCâ€™s and not just introducing it but also helping the teams to embrace new automation tools and changes that had happened. Thanks a lot for your contributions and all the best for your future!
